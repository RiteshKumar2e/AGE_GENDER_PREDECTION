##Face Age and Gender Prediction
This project demonstrates age and gender prediction using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module.

##Overview
The project includes Python scripts to predict the age and gender of faces in images. It utilizes pre-trained models for age and gender classification.

##Dependencies
OpenCV (cv2): pip install opencv-python
Pre-trained models: age_deploy.prototxt, age_net.caffemodel, gender_deploy.prototxt, gender_net.caffemodel
##Usage
Clone this repository.
Install dependencies using pip.
Ensure your images are in the correct format (preferably in JPG or PNG).
Run the predict_age_and_gender.py script, passing the path to your images as arguments.
python predict_age_and_gender.py image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.jpg
